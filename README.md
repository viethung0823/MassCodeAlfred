## Introduction
The official [MassCode workflow](https://github.com/massCodeIO/assistant-alfred) uses [Alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy). The latest release, version 1.0.1, is quite large (~20 MB) just for fetching the workflow, and it even requires running npm install to function properly.

Alfy also has performance issues, so in this version, I have switched to using [awgo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo). It is significantly faster compared to Alfy.

Feel free to open a new PR.
